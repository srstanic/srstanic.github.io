Buttons can sometimes be difficult to distinguish from labels in the iOS interfaces with a lot of text. One way to make a button more noticeable is to add a border with a rounded corner to a UIButton view.

Here is a complete RoundedBorderButton class you can use to achieve the same effect:

The class is using [@IBDesignable and @IBInspectable](http://nshipster.com/ibinspectable-ibdesignable/) attributes to enable you to modify the border properties in the Interface Builder and see the results immediately without running the app.

RoundedBorderButton works best when the button type is set to Custom.
